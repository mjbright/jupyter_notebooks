    "A major advantage of Docker is to simplify build environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at how we can build the Docker engine client/daemon binary without having to explicitly install a development environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "<font size=+1 color=\"#77f\">\n",
    "<b>The goal of this step is simply to show the ease with which we can build Docker, thanks to Docker itself.</b>   \n",
    "</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "We do not make particular use of the built image.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process involves the following steps, several of which have already been performed so as to prevent excessive network utilisation during the lab.  Nevertheless all steps are  described here so that you can see just how easy it is to build Docker from scratch:\n",
    "- Install make\n",
    "- Clone the Docker source code\n",
    "- Checkout the same code revision as our current Docker binary (client and daemon)\n",
    "- Build the code - which pulls the docker-dev image containing the required version of the Go compiler\n",
    "- Run the executeable to demonstrate it is correct\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Installing make\n",
    "\n",
    "In your environment we have already installed the make package, but no compiler using yum:\n",
    "\n",
    "    yum install make\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cloning the Docker source code\n",
    "\n",
    "We have already downloaded the Docker source code from github as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    mkdir -p /root/src/docker\n",
    "    cd /root/src/docker\n",
    "    git clone https://github.com/docker/docker .\n",

    "#### Checkout the source code revision corresponding to our installed Docker Engine\n",
