# Lab Installation


The notebooks of this lab are runnable in a Jupyter installation with the bash_kernel installed.

Although that is not the subject of this lab, if you want to create your own environment in which to run this lab with Docker components already installed (and even Jupyter/bash_kernel)

## TODO: Describe usage of vagrant to run this environment
